# Health Checks

`OPToggles` exposes several endpoints for health checks by external services:

`/health/live`
Returns `200` as long as `OPToggles` runs.


`/health/started`  
Returns `200` if init sequence is done, including:
* Retrieving OPA's address
* Registering the update callback 
* Creating the toggles 
  
Returns `503` if the sequence init wasn't completed.

`/health` <br/>
Returns `200` if started and running without errors.  
Returns `500` if there's an ongoing failure to query OPA or update to the target instance.
