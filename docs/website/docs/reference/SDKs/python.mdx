# Python

## Add the SDK to your Python code

Init the Python SDK and check for permissions.

1. Install the Permit.io SDK:

```
pip install permit
```

2. Add the SDK to your code (in the top of your py file):

```python
from permit import Permit
```

3. Create a new instance of the SDK:

```python
# This line initializes the SDK and connects your python app
# to the Permit.io PDP container you've set up.
permit = Permit(
    # in production, you might need to change this url to fit your deployment
    pdp="http://localhost:7000",
    # your api key
    token="<your-api-key>",
)
```

4. Check for permissions:

```python
permitted = await permit.check(user["id"], "create", "document")

if permitted:
    print("User is permitted to create a document")
else:
    print("is NOT PERMITTED to create document!")
```

## Full app example

The following is a Python app with a single file, with `permit` and `FastAPI` modules installed.

Create a new directory for your new python project:

```
mkdir hello-permissions && cd hello-permissions
```

Optionally, create a new virtual environment for your project (you might need to install pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv):

```
pyenv virtualenv permissions && pyenv activate permissions
```

Now install the Permit.io SDK (We'll also install the FastAPI and Uvicorn packages in order to run an HTTP server in our example):

```
pip install permit fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"
```

Create a file called test.py:

```
touch test.py
```

Copy the following code inside test.py and replace with your `api key` and `user-object`:  
You can find instructions on getting an API key [here](../../tutorials/quickstart#2-get-permitio-api-key)

```python
import asyncio

from permit import Permit
from fastapi import FastAPI, status, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

# This line initializes the SDK and connects your python app
# to the Permit.io PDP container you've set up in the previous step.
permit = Permit(
    # in production, you might need to change this url to fit your deployment
    pdp="http://localhost:7000",
    # your api key
    token="[YOUR_API_KEY]",
)

# Example user object
# You would usually get the user from your authenticantion layer (e.g. Auth0, Cognito, etc) via a JWT token or a database.
user = {
    "id": "[user-id]",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@permit.io",
}

@app.get("/")
async def check_permissions():
    permitted = await permit.check(user["id"], "create", "document")
    if not permitted:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail={
            "result": f"{user.get('firstName')} {user.get('lastName')} is NOT PERMITTED to create document!"
        })

    return JSONResponse(status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK, content={
        "result": f"{user.get('firstName')} {user.get('lastName')} is PERMITTED to create document!"
    })

```

Now that your application is ready, let's run it:

```
uvicorn test:app --reload --port=4000
```

Finally, go to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see the outcome of the permission check.
