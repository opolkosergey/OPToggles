## Sync Open-Policy to your Frontend

When developing a new feature, often we seek to control which users can access and interact. <br/>
For example, we want to make sure only subscribers can access paid features. <br/>
If the user has no permissions, we decide whether we show the feature disabled or hide the feature altogether. <br/>
We enforce a policy that states: which [user] can perform [actions] on [resource].

OPToggles (Open Policy Toggles) is an open-source project that brings the power of `OPA` and `OPAL` into your frontend through existing feature flagging solutions. <br/>
OPToggles automatically creates user-targeted feature flags based on your existing authorization rules, pushes them to the feature flag solution, and keeps them synced thanks to OPAL's real-time policy and policy-data event-driven architecture.

- OPToggles uses `OPA` as the source of truth for what policy is true for the user.
- OPToggles uses `OPAL` to get real-time policy/data updates.

With OPToggles, frontend devs can continue to enjoy working with the feature flags solutions they already use.
There‚Äôs a one-time effort for backend developers configuring OPToggles to connect to OPA and OPAL, and all the rest is automatic.

Currently, OPToggles works with [LaunchDarkly](https://www.launchdarkly.com) and with a Generic REST API.
[Let us know](https://bitly.com/permit-slack) if you'd like to see OPToggles integrated with other feature flag solutions, or better yet contribute one with a pull request on [OPToggles' Github](https://github.com/permitio/OPToggles).

OPToggles is part of [Permit‚Äôs](https://www.permit.io) suite of open source solutions.

- Add the admin role to Alice.
- Commit the new policy.
- Alice can immediately see "Flag On", without any code changes.
