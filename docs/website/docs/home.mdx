## Sync Open-Policy to your Frontend

When developing a new feature, we often need to control which users can access and interact with it. <br/>
(For example, we might want to make sure only subscribers can access paid features) <br/>
If the user has no permissions to use the feature, we decide whether we display the feature disabled or hide it altogether. <br/>

OPToggles (Open Policy Toggles) is an open-source project that utilizes [OPA + OPAL](https://github.com/permitio/opal) into your existing feature toggling solution. <br/>
OPToggles automatically creates user-targeted feature flags based on your existing authorization rules, pushes them to the feature flag solution, and keeps them synced using OPAL's real-time policy and policy-data event-driven architecture.

- OPToggles uses `OPA` as the source of truth regarding what users are authorized for each feature toggle.
- OPToggles uses `OPAL` to get real-time policy/data updates.

OPToggles requires a one-time configuration to connect to  OPA and OPAL, and the rest is automatic.

Currently, OPToggles works with [LaunchDarkly](https://www.launchdarkly.com) and with a Generic REST API.
[Let us know](https://bit.ly/permitioslack) if you'd like to see OPToggles integrated with other feature flag solutions, or better yet contribute one with a pull request on [OPToggles' Github](https://github.com/permitio/OPToggles).

OPToggles is part of [Permit‚Äôs](https://www.permit.io) suite of open source solutions.

In the GIF, you can see how we:

- Add the admin role to Alice.
- Commit the new policy.
- Alice can immediately see "Flag On", without any code changes.
